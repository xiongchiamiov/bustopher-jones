Oh my, this is old.

This is an organically-grown framework created by my reading of a PHP book from O'Reilly while writing websites for a few people.  When I was forcefully introduced to symfony, I realized that I was re-inventing (poorly) things that had been done many times before, so this got left by the wayside.  I've never put it up somewhere, though, so it's now on GitHub for posterity.
